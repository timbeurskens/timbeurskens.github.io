  ## Hi there!
---

At this moment there isn't much going on here.

I'm currently working on an article for my [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem)-solver.
This is a small project I've been working on over the last year and I want to highlight my experiences in [Go](https://golang.org/) and the challenges (and opportunities) in SAT-related problems.

Other projects, such as my Lindenmayer-system carpet-pattern generator, will be posted on this website somewhere in the future as well.
