  ## Hi there!
---

I've recently published my first article on use cases for [boolean satisfiability solvers]({% post_url /_posts/2022-03-15-why-sat-solvers %}).
Satisfiability solvers have intrigued me for some time now so I decided to write an article on why I think more people should focus on SAT in their development efforts. Until now I've just scratched the surface of constraint solvers. Later I will write about more advanced solvers and practical applications.

[Let me know]({% post_url /about %}) what you think of it!

Other projects, such as my Lindenmayer-system carpet-pattern generator, will be posted on this website somewhere in the future as well.
